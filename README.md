# What is Alptail?

Alptail is a collection of open-source UI components, using [Tailwind.css](http://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). Regularly updated and on a mission to make them as accessible as possible. Maintained by [Daniel Palmer](https://www.twitter.com/userlastname).

This static site is built with Tighten's awesome Laravel Blade based [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) generator.

[See a demo of the components here.](https://www.alptail.com/)
